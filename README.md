## 🚀 Project Overview

**Finance Agentic AI** is an intelligent, autonomous agent designed to empower users with deep financial insights, personalized recommendations, and task execution across various financial domains. Built with state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic frameworks, this system acts as a financial co-pilot — researching market trends, analyzing portfolios, extracting key insights, and performing automated reasoning over structured and unstructured data.

Whether you're a retail investor, data analyst, or financial enthusiast, this AI agent offers a powerful toolset to streamline your financial decision-making.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🔎 **Autonomous Financial Research**: Given a query (e.g., "Compare Tesla and Ford over the last 5 years"), the agent autonomously fetches data, analyzes trends, and generates an insightful summary.
- 📈 **Data-Driven Decisions**: Integrates with APIs to pull real-time financial data and applies reasoning and LLM-driven summarization to produce actionable insights.
- 💬 **Natural Language Interaction**: Users can query using simple English prompts, and the agent takes care of planning and execution behind the scenes.
- 🛠️ **Agentic Workflow**: Employs planning, tool-use, memory, and feedback loops to emulate intelligent decision-making.
- 📊 **Report Generation**: Outputs formatted reports including financial metrics, comparisons, and visualizations.
- 🌐 **Web Scraping & API Integration**: Gathers info from news, social platforms, and financial data providers.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **LLMs**: OpenAI GPT-4 / GPT-3.5 (LangChain-powered)
- **Agent Framework**: LangChain Agent + Tools
- **Python Libraries**: `yfinance`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `plotly`, `requests`, `bs4`, `streamlit`
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly
- **UI**: Streamlit
- **Memory & Context**: LangChain Memory

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **User Prompt**: Input a query such as _"Analyze Apple stock vs Microsoft for the last 10 years."_
2. **Planning & Tool Selection**: The agent uses a planner to determine necessary tools (e.g., `yfinance`, plotting libraries, web search).
3. **Execution & Reasoning**: Tools are called iteratively, memory is updated, and results are refined.
4. **Insight Delivery**: Final output is presented with graphs, metrics, and LLM-based explanations.
